print(f"So right now im tryna read more and thought it would be a good idea to go through them. The first book is by a well know black revolutionary named {media[0].title()}, dont know much about it so far but will keep on reading. Then im also reading metamorphosis by {media[1].title()}, read around a third of the book. Im also currently playing a game called {media[2].title()} and it's fucking amazing. And at last i finally watched {media[3].title()}, it was a solid 8/10 but could've been much better(the riddler carried hard)")
